# Hide / Seek

An Action where you give 1 random person the 'Gold' role. This person should be a regular but not too active where the Gold role can be taken. One user found the target, they can steal the role and hide so they don't get caught.

Note: If you have Server Boost, you can attach a role icon to this role so it's easier for people to find if user chats.

1) Replace "potGold" with your gold role
2) Press Save
3) Give 1 person with the gold role
4) Tell them to hide
